                                Hello! I’m Alora Bucey, a graphic design major at Northwest Missouri State University, where I’m also minoring in Digital Media. I’ll be graduating in May 2026 and am excited to continue my journey in both the design and creative industries. Along with my academic pursuits, I’m in a tattoo apprenticeship and hope to soon expand my career in that direction.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Currently, I serve as the Editor-in-Chief for the Tower Yearbook, where I’ve been a designer for the past three publications. I’m also active in the 102nd Student Senate, where I’ve climbed the ranks from associate member to co-chair of the Civic Service Committee on the Senate Cabinet. I plan to carry these leadership skills into both the civilian and military sectors.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I’ve proudly served in the US Army for four years, with plans to continue my service for a total of 20. These experiences have taught me discipline, teamwork, and the value of hard work, which I apply to everything I do.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I’m skilled in coding, Adobe Suite, mechanics, sculpture, traditional art mediums, and management. Outside of my professional pursuits, I’m a proud pet owner to Captain Max, my lovable mastiff, and Mjolnir, my mischievous cat. When I’m not working, you can find me bowling with my league, line dancing, or enjoying a night out with friends.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I believe in blending creativity with functionality. My approach is grounded in strong communication and a desire to create impactful, user-centered designs. Whether it's managing a large-scale publication or designing a tattoo, I’m always looking for innovative ways to bring concepts to life.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you’d like to collaborate or have any questions, feel free to reach out. Let’s make something amazing together!
